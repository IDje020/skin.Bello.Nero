### **About**
ßειισ ηεrσ skin for Kodi-Leia 18.xx.
<br>Inspired by a Krypton version of BELLO skin, personally revised and corrected by me ßειισ ηεrσ combines elegance and versatility that distinguish it. It is a unique graphic interface enriched with new contents.

<br>

### **Credits**
I thank Nessus mainly for creating and making available Bello 6, a beautiful, very elegant, well-made and unique leather. I also thank, eQUIV and iCanuck who have added their personal touch and have helped to carry out the project over the years trying to make alive even the work done previously. I hope that my contribution and the work done to date for this updated version for Kodi Leia 18.xx can be appreciated. I also thank the Team Kodi / XBMC, for all the work done in all these years to improve more and more Kodi software and everything that orbits around it and finally all the developers that with their work make it possible to improve the experience and use of Kodi.

<br>

### **Donations**
ßειισ ηεrσ is free without constraints, so like me, other people can use this skin with the legendary and unique KODI.
In any case, every recognition will be greatly appreciated.
